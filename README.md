## Problem Statement
When we visit for the doctor we have to answer about our previous diseases and the medications we usualy take. Also during the diagnosis if the patient is found to be having wrong medicines
its very difficult to found where the things got wrong. So it is important to keep the track of all the medical checkup history. Also it is very important that only you can control
who can see your personal information.

## Solution
Created an online Medical History Tracker so that we can access to our history anywhere we want. Give the access to see our history only to specific doctors so that they could precribe 
medicine accordingly and update your current history.
